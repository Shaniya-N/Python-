CLASSES

->Classes represents real-world things and situations, and objects are created based on these classes.
->It acts as a blue print for creating objects.
->When a class is created,the  the general behavior f the  whole category of objects are defined.
->When individual objects are created from a class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behaviors;
  unique traits for each object can be given afterwards.

OBJECTS

->Objects are instances of a class.
->A class can have any number of objects

INSTANTIATION

->Making an object of a class is called instantiation, and we work with instances of a class.

CREATING A CLASS

class Car():
    def __init__(self,model,color):
        self.model = model
        self.color=color
    def milage(self):
        print(f"{self.model.title()} has good milage)
    def speed(self):
        print(f"{self.model.title()} has good speed)

->Car() :
    It is the name of the class, it starts with an upper case
->A function inside a class is called a "METHOD"
->__init__ method:
    It is a special method Python runs automatically whenever a new instance is created.
    The self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come before other parameters

    Every method call associated with a class automatically passes self, which 
    is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to 
    the attributes and methods in the class.

->self
    -> It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this __init__() method
    later (to create an instance of Car), the method call will automatically pass the self argument. 
    ->Every method call associated with a class automatically passes self, which is a reference to the instance itself; 
    it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class.

->self.model ,self.color
    Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and weâ€™ll also be 
    able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. 
    Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called "ATTRIBUTES".
